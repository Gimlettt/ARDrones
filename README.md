The main aim of this project was to design and develop an AR system to support the attachment of propellers to a new modular delivery drone system. This demonstrator was specifically designed to work with the state-of-the-art Microsoft HoloLens 2 head-mounted display (HMD) platform, allowing for unconstrained hand movement when attaching drone modules. The AR demonstrator is shared under the MIT open license.
